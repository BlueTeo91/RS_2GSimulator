BS MAX TX_POWER = 10 W  (40 dBm)

MS MAX UL_POWER = 2 W  (33 dBm)

MODULATION TYPE: FTDMA/FDD - Separate frequency bands for DL and UL

CENTRAL BANDWIDTH FREQUENCY => f = 900 MHz

TOTAL BANDWIDTH AVAILABLE TO THE NETWORK OPERATOR = 7 MHz

CHANNEL BANDWIDTH = 200 KHz

NUMBER OF FREQUENCY SUBCARRIERS AVAILABLE FOR THE NETWORK OPERATOR = 35

CHANNEL DATA RATE = 271 Kbps

USER THROUGHPUT FOR VOICE CALLS (FULL RATE) = 13 Kbps

LINK ACTIVE STATE = 0,45 (both for DL and UL) 

NUMBER OF SLOTS PER FRAME = 8 (one occupied by the Beacon signal transmitted at maximum power)

FRAME DURATION = 4,6 ms

TIME SLOT DURATION = 577 ms

CLUSTER SIZE => K = 7

TOTAL NUMBER OF RADIO RESOURCES PER CELL = (35/(8-1))*7 = 35

OMNI-DIRECTIONAL ANTENNAS GAIN = 15 dBi

MIN RX_LEVEL(MS) = -102 dBm

MIN RX_LEVEL(BS) = -104 dBm

PATH LOSS EXPONENT: urban environment => alfa = 3,6

MAXIMUM PATH LOSS =>  L = BS MAX TX_POWER - MIN RX_LEVEL(MS) = 40 dBm - (-102 dBm) = 142 dB

HEIGHT OF BS => hBS = 30 m

HEIGHT OF MS => Negligible

ORIGINAL OKUMURA-HATA FORMULA:

L = 69,55 + 26,16*log(f[MHz]) - 13,82*log(hBS) + (44,9 - 6,55*log(hBS)*logR[Km]

142 dB = 69,55 + 26,16*log(900) - 13,82*log(30) + (44,9 - 6,55*log(30)*logR[Km]

R = 3,044 Km
